title: "IoT environmental monitoring for decision markers"
excerpt: "I have designed many IoT environmental monitoring systems for my postdoctoral projects since 2014. My main objective for designing IoT systems is to capture the changing environment and plant growth and make automation understand what to take actions in real-time. The systems have been used in scientific projects and results have been processed for publications. My interdisciplinary experiences help me a lot to deliver outstanding and innovative IT solutions to create an interface between study objects and hardware/software. I was able to provide a quick and cost-effective solution to a data import problem or an intricate workflow. <br/><img src='/images/IoT_weather_station.png'>"

Some research-grade agricultural instrumentations and IoT environmental monitoring systems I designed and validated in recent years:

1. Micro-scale weather station and embedded sensor network based on cellular towers for real-time atmospheric and environmental monitoring.
1. Remote sensing  scanner and motorized sliding system to quantify canopy height and turf quality.
1.	Load cell based micro-lysimeter array to measure real-time evapotranspiration in growth chambers.
1.	Portable turf tensile strength and traction tester to monitor the stability of athletic field turfgrass and biomass structure.
1.	High precision hot-wire anemometer for measuring air ow from all directions.
1.	Micro-scale auto spray system for hydroponics and horticulture.
1.	Real-time monitoring software and communication tools.
1.	Dynamically controlled multiple spectrum LED panels.
1.	A camera light-box and image processing program to report greenness and counting objects.
1.	Automatic drip irrigation to multiple plants with one self-priming pump and multiple valves.  

These devices have been applied and collected dataset for publications. Throughout these hands-on experience, I have demonstrated an excellent ability to multi-task, planning and executing complex tasks under pressure of deadlines with an ambiguous and changing environment and to work independently with little supervision.
