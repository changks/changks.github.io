title: "IoT environmental monitoring for decision markers"
excerpt: "I have designed many IoT environmental monitoring systems for my postdoctoral projects since 2014. My main objective for designing IoT systems is to capture the changing environment and plant growth and make automation understand what to take actions in real-time.  My innovations are tested, validated and used in field, laboratory and controlled environments. I also noticed that the existing monitoring systems/sensors are expensive and too big to fit into many cropping systems. In addition, the pressing issue in increasing the accuracy of precision agriculture and simulation is to solve the spatial/temporal resolution issus in the monitoring systems and simulations. Therefore, I have integrated industrial-grade sensors and ultrasonic anemometer together in a very tiny water-proof case so that it can be place in any locations in a greenhouse, growth chamber, within canopy, and in various locations in a field.  The monitoring systems can significantly increase the accuracy of agricultural simulation and recommendations for growers. The comprehensive system at a high spatial/temporal resolution enables growers to assign discrete factors to each crop/field/system, and track for performance of management practices. <br/><img src='/images/IoT_weather_station.png'>"

My interdisciplinary experiences help me a lot to deliver outstanding and innovative IT solutions to create an interface between study objects and hardware/software. I was able to provide a quick and cost-effective solution to a data import problem or an intricate workflow. Some research-grade agricultural instrumentations and IoT environmental monitoring systems I designed and validated in recent years:

1. Micro-scale weather station and embedded sensor network based on cellular towers for real-time atmospheric and environmental monitoring.
1. Environmental monitoring system based on remote sensing technologies.
1. Motorized sliding CNC machinery for monitoring automation.
1. High precision hot-wire anemometer for measuring air flow from all directions.
1. Real-time monitoring software and communication tools.
1. IoT-based actuator and power control systems. 
1. A camera light-box and image processing program to report greenness and counting objects.

These devices have been applied and collected dataset for publications. Throughout these hands-on experience, I have demonstrated an excellent ability to multi-task, planning and executing complex tasks under pressure of deadlines with an ambiguous and changing environment and to work independently with little supervision.
