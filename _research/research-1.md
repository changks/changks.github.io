title: "Precision agriculture, big data analysis & cloud computing"
excerpt: "In my Ph.D. studies, I worked on various crop models that integrate the understanding of crop physiology gathered from many years of laboratory and field experimentations. Therefore, results provided an effective means for investigating crop responses to climate change and alternative management scenarios. I have published my results to the peer-reviewed journals in Agronomy Journal and Soil Science Society American Journal. These publications demonstrated that my skill set in the application of crop physiology to climate change impact and adaptation research through the use of physiology-based crop models. Agriculture have to contribute to the mitigation of climate change, with crop models playing a role. <br/><img src='/images/GH_PA_heatmap.png'>"

I collaborated with Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) and other scientists at the University of Guelph to develop new technologies and methodologies for improving profitability in an increasingly competitive and volatile environment. For example, I developed field-validated technologies and methodologies to increase yield production based on the big data of (1) phenology camera, (2) LiDAR sensor array, (3) 3D Time of Flight Flash LiDAR, (4) load cell array, (5) invisible weather station, (6) soil water content/soil temperature/air quality sensors (7) motion-based field quality scanner, (8) RTK-GPS for routing recommendation, (9) tensile strength meter for testing plant structure, (10) linear motion CNC machine for sensor scanning, (11) environment monitoring mesh network for indoor and greenhouse farming, (12) Google Could-based auto-mapping, and (13) a suite of data processing programs. I am confident on my inventions for precision agriculture. They are marketable and advanced tools for monitoring the inter- and intra-variability in crops and fields.
