title: "Transport of air pollution"
excerpt: "I use air pollution models to see the air movement, trajectory, and dry/wet deposition. This example shows the model validation based on the Chernobyl accident. My modeling work related to air quality includes the NOAA-HYSPLIT and AERMOD atmospheric dispersion modeling systems. In particular, I developed an early-warning system for nuclear power accidents for East Asia in 2002. This work has been referred to developing a monitoring network in Taiwan and applied to evaluate the impacts of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. I participated in Colorado Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation Air Quality Study (CAFO) and designed a Monte Carlo approach for the dispersion model to simulate greenhouse gas emissions from a dairy farm at a fine spatial scale. I also had an opportunity to work with a consulting company to conduct the environment assessment for the tallest building (Taipei 101) in Taiwan, monitoring/simulating wind field and particle dispersion. As my solid educational background (B.Sc. and M.Sc.) in atmospheric sciences and my role of being the deputy chief of weather station, I am capable of conducting operations, maintenance, calibration and repair of delicate air monitoring and meteorological instrumentation. <br/><img src='/images/Chernobyl_120h_deposition_300x500.png'>"

My M.Sc. work published in 2002 was highlighted in newspapers and talk shows, especially during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011.
