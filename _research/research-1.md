title: "Precision agriculture, big data analysis & cloud computing"
excerpt: "During my last stage of PDF (2014 – 2016) at the University of Guelph, I was included as a co-PI to develop and lead a comprehensive study integrating agro-ecological concepts in with data-intensive precision agriculture tools (e.g. remote sensing, geographic information systems, variable rate application technology) to enhance economic and environmental sustainability of field crop production.  I have been interested in deploying new sensor and cloud computing technologies to support precision and intensive cropping systems. I devotedly studied functions and algorithms related to biogeochemistry and plant/crop physiology and validate them with data collected from the field and the controlled environment.  <br/><img src='/images/GH_PA_heatmap.png'>"

I have noticed that concerns from industrial partners are the adaptation of precision farming tools: (1) profitability: costs, margin, and market, (2) efficiency: performance and saving, and (3) sustainability: social, environmental, and economic influences. Adapting precision farming has become more of a business decision. I am confident on my inventions are field-validated, low-cost, and advanced systems. I want to innovate the right tools for field operation and help drive more uptake by farmers. Based on my experiences with various interdisciplinary collaborations, , I believe that I can do a good job at AAFC and keep designing precision agriculture applications and conducting advanced researches.

As for working on large field experiments for my PDF, I applied spatial data analysis and probability analysis using R. In particular, I collected datasets in the field; from this analysis, I developed heat maps for interpreting results. Collecting spatial data from equipment and sensors that allowed farms to pinpoint the high yield areas. Also, using GPS data and GIS technologies determine where to increase or decrease pesticides, fertilizers use and irrigation. Farms started to utilize this technology to increase the accuracy of operational spatial data. I worked intensively to integrate GIS, sensor network in the field, and data mining for precision agriculture. For example, I developed the methods and process of GIS and data post-processing applied in soil spatial analysis, involving the collection of soil spatial data that GIS required, spatial analysis method of soil climate, soil nutrient, land use, slope (vehicle movement on the terrain) and exposure of geography, crop yield and other factors (plant health condition), acquiring soil spatial information and creating thematic map, etc. I believe that farm management relies on data, and data analysis is to support farmer’s decision-making to decrease inputs.

I started to use open-sourced APIs provided by Google on precision agriculture applications. To this end, I believe that future wok on analyzing and interpreting plant/crop physiological data should incorporate (1) parallel streaming statistics, (2) analysis and visualization pipelines, (3) optimized parallel I/O, (4) remote interactive execution, (5) workflow capabilities, and (6) automatic data provenance processing and capturing. This will contribute to solve the on-site decision making and further field adoption in precision agriculture. During my Ph.D. and PDF, I offered a series of novel graphical user interface and scripting capabilities for scientists that include workflow data analysis, visualization construction tools, and the ability to easily add custom functionality. These features were enhanced by using Google platform, R/Python statistical analysis tool, and advancements in state-of-the-art visualization, and therefore were brought together via a user interface.
