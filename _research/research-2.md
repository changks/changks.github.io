title: "Cropping sytem in greenhouse & controlled environment"
excerpt: "To be sustainable and innovative, future agriculture requires production systems that are resilient to natural/human stressors.
In the past, I worked on cropping sytem in greenhouse & controlled environment and validated strategies for managing natural/human stressors that are responsive to more stakeholders and build resilience into industrialized crop production.
I used various models, low-cost monitoring systems, machine learning, and automation for supporting Canadian growers to deal with prospective management practices and climate change. <br/><img src='/images/Cropping_LCA.png'>"

I innovated new monitoring and automation systems for precision and intensive cropping systems. Specifically, I have designed and validated the following projects for cropping sytem in greenhouse & controlled environment.

1. Load cell based micro-lysimeter array to measure real-time evapotranspiration in growth chambers.
1. Dynamically controlled multiple spectrum LED panels.
1. Low-cost phenological camera and image-processing system to reflect the condition of plant growth for automation. 
1. Portable tensile strength and traction tester to monitor the stability of field quality and biomass structure.
1. Micro-scale auto spray system for hydroponics and horticulture.
1. Automatic drip irrigation to multiple plants with one self-priming pump and multiple valves.
1. Micro-scale weather station and ultrasonic anemometer.
