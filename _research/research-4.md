title: "Effects of climate change on plant growth"
excerpt: "For my PDF work at University of Toronto, I particularly interested in climate change regarding elevated ambient CO$_2$ and drought that may consequently affect the growth of crops. In this study, the effects of drought on photosynthesis, soil enzyme activities and woody biomass were programmed into the model. These methodologies can be further applied to simulate the impacts of climate change on cropping systems. I have gained a deep understanding how water stress regulates the plant growth and how to characterize the effects of water stress in a relatively complicated expression in the dynamic vegetation model.

In 2011 â€“ 2014, I extended my research domain from cropping system to meteorological effects (i.e., drought) on plant physiology.
