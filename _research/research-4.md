title: "Effects of climate change on plant growth"
excerpt: "For my PDF work at University of Toronto, I particularly interested in climate change regarding elevated ambient CO$_2$ and drought that may consequently affect the growth of crops. In this study, the effects of drought on photosynthesis, soil enzyme activities and woody biomass were programmed into the model. These methodologies can be further applied to simulate the impacts of climate change on cropping systems. I have gained a deep understanding how water stress regulates the plant growth and how to characterize the effects of water stress in a relatively complicated expression in the dynamic vegetation model.

In 2011 – 2014, I extended my research domain from cropping system to meteorological effects (i.e., drought) on plant physiology.

I am passionate about studying a variety of research topics on the interface between the atmosphere and land surface, particularly focusing on the impacts of changing environment on plants. Therefore, I studied the field of plant physiology, plant science, ecology, and micrometeorology for my Ph.D. at Colorado State University and the University of Guelph. 

I always illustrate different parts of plants function in the format of mathematics. I use a matrix of equations and algorithms to explain how plants develop from seeds, and how they grow as well as many aspects of plant life, including nutrition, movement, and growth. In order to fully understand the plant physiology in the model, I studied intensively the process of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in different plant functional types to predict plant-atmosphere interactions in a changing climate and to integrate new knowledge in physiological and ecological theories. These fundamental knowledges of formulating plant physiology in the biogeochemical and agricultural models have played an important role in communicating scientific results and creating other projects in precision agriculture.

I became an interdisciplinary researcher through obtaining multiple degrees in different fields, participating in different studies, working in different laboratories and even starting up a company. In 2008 – 2011, I participated in several ecological studies and modeling projects to better understanding the terrestrial ecosystem. I was involved the projects – Elora Cropping Research Station, Konza Prairie LTER Station, Air Emission from Dairy CAFO, DOE-USDA Carbon Project, Yellowstone National Park Biodiversity Project and Rocky Mountain Watershed Project. I therefore developed my interdisciplinary ability, strengthened my team work capability, and learned how to integrate modeling theories with field measurements. In 2011 – 2014, I extended my research domain from cropping system to meteorological effects (i.e., drought) on plant physiology. I realized an accurate information for decision making relies on a high resolution (and low cost) sensor network and integrated platform of pattern recognition algorithm and simulations. Therefore, I founded an agricultural company promoting all-in-one weather station and artificial intelligence farming system. In 2014 – present, I started to work with a group of scientists with various backgrounds in turfgrass science, meteorology, engineering, and plant agriculture on the Toronto Blue Jays Natural Grass Project. My job was to innovate novel sensor technologies to monitor the changing environment and its impacts on plants. Because of my unique educational background and experience, I am able to propose research ideas that can satisfy the project goals and further be used in commercial applications.
