My research focuses on the optimization of precision and intensive cropping system. I also make use of computer models, data mining, and cloud computing to interpret field measurements. I innovate robotics and embedded sensor network to monitor the atmosphere and biophysical changes.

Data-driven agronomic applications
======
1. **Computer simulation**: improve and validate meteorological models, long-range transport models, biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models to study land-atmosphere interactions for climate variability.
1. **Statistical analysis**: quantify greenhouse gases/carbon cycles and biophysical changes by processing large scientific datasets.
1. **Meteorological and environmental monitoring**: design embedded sensor network and robotics to detect plant stress physiology and changing environment.
1. **Precision Agriculture**: integrate software, hardware and machinary as a user-friendly package to increase profits and crop productivity.

As a scientist, I make use of tools to study past climatic variability and real-time weather condition and their impacts on crop/plant physiology to gain clues that will help growers and industry partners plan for future climate change and precision automation. I publish major scientific findings, secure fundings to engage and grow my researches with others colleagues, communities and industries.

Profitability
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Efficiency
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

A day of my life
======

A look at the demanding schedule of my day, that stays in focus, effective communication, and largely avoids entertainments.
![A look at the demanding schedule of my day](/images/DayofLife.png)


I like to do greats. My daily life is pretty jam-packed.

I kicks off my day bright and early, rising at about 7 a.m. In average, I usually got six hours of shut-eye. My most important daily habit in the morning -- Wake Up Yoga and Coffee.

I launch into a blistering schedule that breaks my time into a series of 30-minute slots. 

I work 85 to 100 hours a week, and I estimate that 80% of my time at work is spent on programming, engineering and system validation.


I generally spend a full workweek at University of Guelph, wolfing down lunch in five minutes, and skipping phone calls and entertainments for productivity's sake.



The Tesla and SpaceX founder generally spends a full workweek at each of his two companies, wolfing down lunch in five minutes and skipping phone calls for productivity's sake.




As a research scientist, on a day-to-day basis I engage in problem identification and solving, using rigorous scientific methodology to analyze data, draw conclusions and communicate results. 

The range of professional environments I have worked in, including research institution, government, nonprofit organization, and consulting company – as well as a hi-tech farming company I created – has made me adept and comfortable interacting with anyone at any level in an organization. What I find most engaging is to “meet people where they are at”; that is, to understand each individual’s perspective and their stake, access their abilities and goals, and develop strategies to meet our common goal.

I am a dynamic and motivated as a communicator when I have the ability to present my scientific results and innovative ideas, and I am able to hear those of other interested collaborators, and am proud of the work we have produced. In addition to my verbal presentation skills, I have proven myself an effective scientist, as evidenced by both my published papers and by the company I started. Lastly, I have supervised fellow workers in both scientific and non-scientific settings.
