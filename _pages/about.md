My research focuses on the optimization of precision and intensive cropping system. I also make use of computer models, data mining, and cloud computing to interpret field measurements. I innovate robotics and embedded sensor network to monitor the atmosphere and biophysical changes.

Four modules of research -- driving for future farming
======

As a scientist, I make use of tools to study past climatic variability and real-time weather condition and their impacts on crop/plant physiology to gain clues that will help growers and industry partners plan for future climate change and precision automation.

1. **Computer simulation**: improve and validate meteorological models, long-range transport models, biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models to study land-atmosphere interactions for climate variability.
1. **Statistical analysis**: quantify greenhouse gases/carbon cycles and biophysical changes by processing large scientific datasets.
1. **Meteorological and environmental monitoring**: design embedded sensor network and robotics to detect plant stress physiology and changing environment.
1. **Precision Agriculture**: integrate software, hardware and machinary as a user-friendly package to increase profits and crop productivity.

I publish major scientific findings, secure fundings to engage and grow my researches with others colleagues, communities and industries. I also work with university intellectual property centre and industry partners to file patents.

Three areas of focus -- engaging with industries
======

I love my job in academia, innovating creative and advanced research with unlimited freedom. As a entrepreneur in the university, I follow my passion and think how to contribute my work to industries. From my experiences of collaborating with industry partners, I nail down three areas of focus to examine my industrial engagement.

1. **Profitability**: I establish a strong communication linkage with the business stakeholders (face-to-face meetings on a regular basis, develop an overall communication routine to supplement the meetings, respond promptly to email/phone requests. I have a good understanding of the business and the project’s strategic context. I clearly indicate (1) *the pain in the market*, (2) *size of pain*, (3) *proposed solution*, (4) *alternatives and similar products*, and (5) *risk assessment*. 
1. **Efficiency**: I conduct leading-edge research to discover tomorrow’s agriculture today. I have a "big picture" to reach the determined goals - what can the company achieve and how can I help them do this? I present well and impute what I want to apply innovations in grower's field. I ensure that innovations can (1) *capture farm data without additional workload*, (2) *increase profits with small investments*, and (3) *seamlessly integrate into their facilities*.
1. **Sustainability**: I respect the industrial collaboration and prepare to invest in long-term relationships. The innovations and services can provide industrial partners to manage social, environmental, and economic aspects of grower's farm. I ensure that innovations features (1) *both immediate/future decisions on best menagement practices*, (2) *the easiest/work-well/reliable solution*, and (3) *IP-protected/recurring profits*.

A day of my life
======

I like to do great things -- dream, believe, plan, and act. Take a look at the demanding schedule of my day, that stays in focus, effective communication, and largely avoids entertainments.

![A look at the demanding schedule of my day](/images/DayofLife.png)


1. **Start my day**: my daily life is pretty jam-packed. I kick off my day bright and early, rising at about 7 a.m. In average, I usually got six hours of shut-eye. My most important daily habit in the morning -- Wake Up Yoga and Coffee. I launch into a blistering schedule that breaks my time into a series of 25-minute slots. Kick-off meetings and brainstorming sessions are particularly important for project management.
1. **Work for future**: I work 85 to 100 hours a week, and I estimate that 80% of my time at work is spent on programming, engineering and system validation. I generally spend a full workweek at University of Guelph, wolfing down lunch in five minutes, and skipping phone calls and entertainments for productivity's sake.
1. **Time with family**: on the weekends, I spends time with my three children to work with them on their projects. I can be with them and still be working at the same time. To stay in shape, I usually hits the gym one hour everyday and kids can also enjoy their freetime in the playroom.
