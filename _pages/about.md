My research focuses on the optimization of precision and intensive cropping system. I also make use of computer models, data mining, and cloud computing to interpret field measurements. I innovate robotics and embedded sensor network to monitor the atmosphere and biophysical changes.

Four modules of research -- driving for future farming
======

As a scientist, I make use of tools to study past climatic variability and real-time weather condition and their impacts on crop/plant physiology to gain clues that will help growers and industry partners plan for future climate change and precision automation.

1. **Computer simulation**: improve and validate meteorological models, long-range transport models, biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models to study land-atmosphere interactions for climate variability.
1. **Statistical analysis**: quantify greenhouse gases/carbon cycles and biophysical changes by processing large scientific datasets.
1. **Meteorological and environmental monitoring**: design embedded sensor network and robotics to detect plant stress physiology and changing environment.
1. **Precision Agriculture**: integrate software, hardware and machinary as a user-friendly package to increase profits and crop productivity.

I publish major scientific findings, secure fundings to engage and grow my researches with others colleagues, communities and industries.

Three areas of focus -- engaging my research with industries
======

I love my job in academia, innovating creative and advanced research with unlimited freedom. As a entrepreneur in the university, I follow my passion and think how to contribute my work to industries. From my experiences of collaborating with industry partners, I nail down three areas of focus to examine my industrial engagement.

1. **Profitability**: The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in 
1. **Efficiency**: The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in 
1. **Sustainability**: The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in

A day of my life
======

I like to do great things -- dream, believe, plan, and act. Take a look at the demanding schedule of my day, that stays in focus, effective communication, and largely avoids entertainments.

1. **Start my day**: my daily life is pretty jam-packed. I kick off my day bright and early, rising at about 7 a.m. In average, I usually got six hours of shut-eye. My most important daily habit in the morning -- Wake Up Yoga and Coffee. I launch into a blistering schedule that breaks my time into a series of 25-minute slots. Kick-off meetings and brainstorming sessions are particularly important for project management.
1. **Work for future**: I work 85 to 100 hours a week, and I estimate that 80% of my time at work is spent on programming, engineering and system validation. I generally spend a full workweek at University of Guelph, wolfing down lunch in five minutes, and skipping phone calls and entertainments for productivity's sake.
1. **Time with family**: on the weekends, I spends time with my three children to work with them on their projects. I can be with them and still be working at the same time. To stay in shape, I usually hits the gym one hour everyday and kids can also enjoy their freetime in the playroom.
