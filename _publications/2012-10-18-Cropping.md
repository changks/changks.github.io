excerpt: 'To be sustainable and innovative, an agroecosystem requires production systems that are resilient to natural/human stressors. In the past, I have been trained and worked on strategies for managing natural/human stressors that are responsive to more stakeholders and build resilience into industrialized crop production. For example, I used various models for understanding responses of Canadian farms to prospective management practices and global changes. I developed new scheme and new modeling approach to improve existing models in simulating a more realistic status of carbon and nitrogen cycles in cropping systems. I also innovate new monitoring and automation system for precision and intensive cropping systems.'

This study presents a validation of the DayCENT model and a 9-yr simulation of the effects of agricultural management practices on C cycle components at the field scale. Observations of site properties and eddy covariance measurements were used to assess crop productivity, net ecosystem productivity, and SOC changes. The validated model captured the dynamics of grain yield and net primary production, which indicated that DayCENT can be used to simulate crop productivity for evaluating the effects of tillage on crop residues and heterotrophic respiration dynamics.
