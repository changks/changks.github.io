excerpt: 'I particularly interested in climate change regarding elevated ambient CO_2 and drought that may consequently affect the growth of crops. In this study, plant physiology, soil carbon, photosynthesis, and soil enzyme activities were programmed to investigate the impacts of elevated CO_2 and drought stress on biomass. I have gained a deep understanding how water stress regulates the plant growth and how to characterize the effects of water stress in a relatively complicated expression in the dynamic vegetation model.'

Dynamic vegetation models can be used to investigate annual impacts of water stress on woody biomass growth, although cumulative physiological effects ofmulti-year droughts on tree mortality would benefit from improved simulation of subgrid-scale (soiltexture-driven) processes. In particular, two areas for further development are: (1) calibration based onthe results of soil surveys at fine spatial/temporal scales; and (2) biophysical experiments to refine therepresentation of water stress constraints on biomass turnover.
