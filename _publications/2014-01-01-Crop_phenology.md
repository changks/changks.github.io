excerpt: 'I carefully studied functions and algorithms related to biogeochemistry and plant/crop physiology and validate them with dataset collected from the field and the controlled environment. I started with the soil science and biogeochemistry, because it is of fundamental importance to many process in land surface. I also conducted other researches to predict biomass, crop productivity, eddy-covariance fluxes, soil respiration, photosynthesis, and phenology etc. These simulations are directly linked to the mechanism of plant growth and our understanding in increasing productivity based on crop physiology.'

Land surface models are useful tools for estimating the contribution and response to climate change of C dynamics in various terrestrial ecosystems. In many land surface models, plant phenological algorithms are incorporated based on field studies in forests. However, to simulate adequately the C cycle over a large area, there is a need to include and validate algorithms for other ecosystems. The Carbon and Nitrogen-coupled Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CN-CLASS) is a land surface model that has been applied successfully to the study of C stocks in forest ecosystems. The objective of this study is to incorporate a simple crop phenology algorithm into CN-CLASS and validate its ability to simulate C cycles at an agricultural site in southern Ontario, Canada.
