excerpt: 'I developed and tested some sensors for quantifying plant healthy and canopy structure. Water restriction was issued during the summer of 2016 in Guelph, so I used that chance to see how soil water and irrigation influence the field.'

Water-use restrictions during the summer of 2016 in Guelph, ON, Canada, prevented the irrigation of natural turf soccer fields and provided a unique opportunity to study the effects on soil volumetric water content and surface hardness on actively used youth soccer fields. Soil volumetric water content and surface hardness were tested on a weekly basis from July through September 2016. Areas of the turf that became brown were compared with the areas that remained green. Surface hardness within areas of brown turfgrass cover frequently exceeded 100g (level of concern for player safety) even though soil volumetric water content was similar between the areas of green and brown turfgrass cover. Therefore, irrigation of sports fields during times of drought is recommended to preserve the cushioning effect of green turfgrass cover.
