title: "Water Restriction Impact on Surface Hardness and Soil Volumetric Water Content on Recreational Sports Fields"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This relationship between soil VWC on surface hardness means that player safety on natural turfgrass sports fields is potentially vulnerable to environmental conditions. Water restrictions in Guelph, ON (City of Guelph, 2016), prohibited all nonessential water use on all recreational fields including two soccer fields at the Guelph Turfgrass Institute (GTI). These fields provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of drought on soil VWC and surface hardness of an actively used playing field and determine whether field conditions to become hard enough so as to be considered an injury risk for players during prolonged drying.'
